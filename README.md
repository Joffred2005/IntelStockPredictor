# IntelStockPredictor

This is a stock prediction neural network implemented with PyTorch from a kaggle dataset of Intel Stock Prices from 1980-2024

Training data was all data prior to 2023, and was split to have a 20% validation data of the training data.

Testing data was on prices of 2024, and it performed to 96% accuracy -- which is shown in the plot at the bottom.

This was a project focused on understanding and building a neural network using PyTorch (though I feel TensorFlow may have been more straightforward to implement).
